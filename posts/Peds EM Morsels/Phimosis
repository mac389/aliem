 We have mentioned before how knowledge of some “less glamorous conditions” can really help make your day go more smoothly in the ED. Knowing how to manage  rectal prolapse ,  constipation ,  recurrent abdominal pain , or  cerumen impaction  may not be what got you motivated to go to work today, but being proficient at these topics does make your shift go more smoothly.  Similarly, it is not uncommon to see a patient with “penis problem.” This could be a big deal or completely normal. Let’s consider  Phimosis  for a minute. 
   
 Phimosis: What is it? 
 
 Refers to the condition when the foreskin (prepuce) cannot be retracted over the glans penis. 
 May be physiologic 
 
 Due to normal adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
 
 Common in male children up to 3 years of life. 
 Can be seen even into the teenage years. 
 
 
 Does not require surgical correction. 
 
 
 May be pathologic 
 
 Due to  scar tissue formation  that prevents retraction of the foreskin. 
 Often associated with:
 
 Recurrent balantitis or balanoposthitis 
 Balanitis xerotica oliterans from  penile lichen sclerosis 
 
 
 Requires correction and, potentially, circumcision. 
 
 
 
   
 Phimosis: Physiologic vs Pathologic 
 
 Physiologic Phimosis
 
 Normal tissue adhesions  prevent full retraction. 
 There is  no scar tissue . 
 The preputial outlet is always closed and the  glans is not visible , unless retractile force is applied  to foreskin (and then only a small area of the glans, if any, is visible). 
 With gentle retractile force, the  inner mucosal surface everts  through outlet. [ McGregor, 2007 ]
 
 Said to “Open like a Flower” (the visual image is odd). 
 
 
 Ballooning can be seen  with physiologic phimosis.
 
 Occurs due to a tight orifice, but a distensible preputial sac. 
 Urination leads to ballooning of the prepuce. 
 Not found to be associated with obstructive voiding and not a mandate for circumcision. [ Babu, 2004 ] 
 
 
 
 
 Pathologic Phimosis
 
 Scar tissue prevents retraction of the foreskin. 
 The  scar tissue will often  hold the preputial outlet open , exposing a portion of the glans  without retractile force being applied. 
 Inner mucosal will not evert  through the outlet when retractile force applied. [ McGregor, 2007 ] 
 
 
 
   
 Phimosis: Management 
 
 Management of physiologic phimosis 
 
 Education and reassurance! 
 Hygiene
 
 Families and children should be taught to  GENTLY retract the foreskin  to the point of resistance during bathing and urination. 
 It  should not be forcefully retracted  (as this may lead to scarring!). [ McGregor, 2007 ] 
 
 
 6-8 week course of topical steroids  can help accelerate the normal process if this is desired.
 
 0.1% triamcinolone applied to preputial outlet BID. 
 
 
 
 
 Management of pathologic phimosis 
 
 Circumcision is the default answer, but… 
 Steroids have been shown to be effective in cases of mild scarring  and can help avoid circumcision.
 
 If phimotic ring persists after steroid therapy, then circumcision is necessary. [ Esposito, 2008 ] 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 Moral of the Morsel 
 
 Like fever,  parents will not overlook a “problem with the penis,”  so becoming well versed in the normal and abnormal and emergent conditions is helpful. 
 The rate of circumcisions has declined and, hence,  the number of patients with physiologic phimosis has increased . 
 Look for  scarring . Look  exposed glans  when no retractile force is applied. These are consistent with  pathologic phimosis and require urologic follow-up .

                    Summary Although there continues to be considerable debate over the merits of circumcision, it is clear that preservation of the pediatric foreskin, even in the presence of phimosis, is a viable option. Steroid topical cream is a painless, less-complicated, and more economical alternative to circumcision for treating phimosis. Success rates are quite high, especially when patient selection is appropriate and parents are adequately instructed on a […]

                    Phimosis is defined as the inability to retract the foreskin. Differentiating between physiological phimosis and pathological phimosis is important, as the former is managed conservatively and the latter requires surgical intervention. Referrals of patients with physiological phimosis to urology clinics may create anxiety regarding the need for surgery amongst patients and parents, while unnecessarily expanding the waiting list for specialty asse […]

                    Circumcision is a commonly performed procedure, but medical indications remain controversial. Most disorders of the penis in childhood can be diagnosed and managed by the primary care pediatrician. However, some require early recognition and surgical intervention, and prompt referral to a pediatric surgeon or urologist will optimize outcome. This article discusses the recognition and initial management of these problems, particularly those most c […]

 I enjoy taking care of patients and I finding it endlessly rewarding to help train others to do the same.  I trained at the Combined Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics residency program at University of Maryland, where I had the tremendous fortune of learning from world renown educators and clinicians.  Now I have the unbelievable honor of working with an unbelievably gifted group of practitioners at Carolinas Medical Center.  I strive every day to inspire my residents as much as they inspire me.
