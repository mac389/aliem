 There are many conditions that I have learned about, yet never seen. Some conditions I was not wise enough to diagnose.  Others conditions patient rarely develop have because of vaccinations!  Unfortunately, despite vaccinations, there are still outbreaks of these important conditions.  We’ve discussed  Measles  and  Pertussis  previously. Now, let us look at  Mumps ! 
   
 Mumps: Basics 
 
 Mumps virus is a  Paramyxoviridae virus . 
 Mumps is a  vaccine preventable disease , although does  still occur in outbreaks .
 
 Large outbreaks recorded in UK (2004), USA (2006, 2009) and Netherlands (2009) [Dayan, 2008; Barskey, 2012;  Sane, 2014 ]
 
 Close to home (like recently in  Charlotte ). 
 
 
 Outbreaks have occurred primarily in  college-aged adults  and  patients too old or too young to have been vaccinated . 
 The  vaccine is not 100% effective  and there are  populations that are unvaccinated . 
 So, while the vaccine has helped substantially, you still may encounter a patient with mumps! 
 
 
 
 
 Compared to measles and pertussis, mumps is generally more benign. [ Hviid, 2008 ]
 
 In pre-vaccine era, mumps was a  major cause of aseptic meningitis . [ Rotbart, 2000 ] 
 
 
 
 
 Mumps shows a seasonality that shows peak in Winter and Spring. 
 Mumps is a self-limited illness and resolves within a few weeks. 
 
   
 Mumps: Presentation 
 
 Like many childhood viral illnesses… it often looks benign at first.
 
 Prodrome 
 
 Fever, malaise, headache. 
 Some will have ear and/or jaw pain. 
 Unfortunately, can be contagious during this time. [ Kutty, 2010 ] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Other clinical findings:
 
 Parotitis 
 
 Most prevalent finding!  
 Seen in 95% of symptomatic patients!  [ Hviid, 2008 ] 
 Occurs in first 2 days of illness. 
 Usually resolves within 1-2 weeks. 
 Angle of mandible is obscured. 
 Bilateral involvement is common. 
 Can involve other salivary glands (not just parotid). 
 
 
 Aseptic Meningitis 
 
 Most common extra-salivary gland clinical finding . 
 CSF Pleocytosis is common (50%), but  clinical meningitis occurs in only up to 15% of cases.  [ Hviid, 2008 ] 
 Encephalitis is rare (0.1%). 
 Permanent sequelae is rare. 
 
 
 Gonadal Involvement 
 
 Oophoritis  (~5%) or  orchitis  (~30%) can occur. 
 Occurs 4-14 days after parotitis, but cases known to occur as late as 6 weeks after. 
 Testicle swelling and tenderness is usually unilateral. Bilateral in 15-30% of cases with orchitis. [ Hviid, 2008 ] 
 Oophoritis can mimic appendicitis. 
 
 
 Pancreatitis 
 
 Seen in 4-5% of cases. 
 Often has  mild  clinical course. 
 Add Mumps to your  Ddx of pancreatitis in kids ! 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 Mumps: Parotitis DDx 
 
 Obviously, other conditions can cause parotid swelling… and are likely more common! [ Hviid, 2008 ] 
 When there is no Outbreak, consider these entities as being more probable. 
 Other Viral Infections 
 
 EBV 
 Parainfluenza virus 
 Adenovirus 
 Influenza A 
 Coxsakievirus 
 Parvo B19 
 Human herpesvirus 6 
 Acute HIV infection 
 
 
 Bacterial Infections 
 
 Staph 
 Atypical mycobacteria 
 
 
 Drugs 
 
 Phenothiazines 
 Iodines 
 Thiouracil 
 
 
 Miscellaneous 
 
 Salivary stones 
 Salivary tumors 
 Malnutrition 
 Diabetes 
 Sjigren’s Syndrome 
 
 
 
   
 Mumps: Diagnosis 
 
 Clinical definition =  Acute onset of unilateral/bilateral parotid swelling  or other salivary glands lasting  2 or more days  without other clear cause. 
 Laboratory diagnosis is based on identifying the mumps virus.
 
 Virus can be isolated from saliva, CSF, urine, or seminal fluid  within the 1 st  week of symptoms ! 
 RT-PCR is usually preferred over viral culture . 
 
 
 Serology (ex, IgM level) is not as helpful as RT-PCR  and effected by timing of sample during illness and previous vaccination status. 
 
   
 Mumps: Treatment 
 
 Symptomatic primarily 
 Avoid salivary-stimulating foods (ex, acidic). 
 Keep away from pregnant women in 1st trimester. 
 Isolate with Standard and Droplet Precautions for 5 days after onset of parotitis. [ Kutty, 2010 ]

                    To analyze the epidemiology of a nationwide mumps epidemic in the Netherlands, we reviewed 1,557 notified mumps cases in persons who had disease onset during September 1, 2009-August 31, 2012. Seasonality peaked in spring and autumn. Most case-patients were males (59%), 18-25 years of age (67.9%), and vaccinated twice with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (67.7%). Nearly half (46.6%) of cases occurred in university students or in persons with studen […]

                    Mumps is a potentially severe viral infection. The incidence of mumps has declined dramatically in high-income countries since the introduction of mumps antigen-containing vaccines. However, recent large outbreaks of mumps in highly vaccinated populations suggest waning of vaccine-induced immunity and primary vaccine failure. In this paper we present a simple method for identifying geographic regions with high outbreak potential, demonstrated usi […]

                    By 2005, vaccination had reduced the annual incidence of mumps in the United States by more than 99%, with few outbreaks reported. However, in 2006, a large outbreak occurred among highly vaccinated populations in the United States, and similar outbreaks have been reported worldwide. The outbreak described in this report occurred among U.S. Orthodox Jewish communities during 2009 and 2010. […]

                    There has been a recent increase in mumps orchitis among pubertal and postpubertal males. These outbreaks can be attributed to a reduction in the uptake of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine during the early to mid-1990 s in children who have now matured. The mumps virus is commonly associated with extra-salivary complications. Unvaccinated postpubertal males diagnosed with mumps virus frequently develop complications such as mumps orchitis. The […]

                    The 2006 mumps resurgence in the United States raised questions about the appropriate isolation period for people with mumps. To determine the scientific basis for isolation recommendations, we conducted a literature review and considered isolation of virus and virus load in saliva and respiratory secretions as factors that were related to mumps transmission risk. Although mumps virus has been isolated from 7 days before through 8 days after paro […]

                    Mumps is a common childhood infection caused by the mumps virus. The hallmark of infection is swelling of the parotid gland. Aseptic meningitis and encephalitis are common complications of mumps together with orchitis and oophoritis, which can arise in adult men and women, respectively; other complications include deafness and pancreatitis. Clinical diagnosis can be based on the classic parotid swelling; however, this feature is not present in al […]

                    The widespread use of a second dose of mumps vaccine among U.S. schoolchildren beginning in 1990 was followed by historically low reports of mumps cases. A 2010 elimination goal was established, but in 2006 the largest mumps outbreak in two decades occurred in the United States. […]

                    Enteroviruses account for 85 to 95% of all cases of aseptic meningitis, but the arboviruses and herpes simplex virus are also important etiologic agents. Mumps, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, herpes zoster, human herpesvirus type 6, and influenza viruses are rare causes of meningitis. The virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic studies, and established and potential antiviral therapies for viral meningitis a […]

 I enjoy taking care of patients and I finding it endlessly rewarding to help train others to do the same.  I trained at the Combined Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics residency program at University of Maryland, where I had the tremendous fortune of learning from world renown educators and clinicians.  Now I have the unbelievable honor of working with an unbelievably gifted group of practitioners at Carolinas Medical Center.  I strive every day to inspire my residents as much as they inspire me.
