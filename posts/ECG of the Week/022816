 What happened ? 
 
 The patient was admitted under the cardiology team for further investigation. 
 
 A cardiac MRI and echo were both normal. 
 
 Given the concern of possible Brugada the patient underwent a flecainide challenge which was negative, excluding Brugada syndrome as a cause of the patient's syncope. 
 
 An implantable loop recorder (ILR) was inserted to monitor for further arrhythmogenic events and the patient was discharge with out patient cardiology follow-up.
