{"The Trauma Professional's Blog-Falls vs. Abuse in Kids-cleansed": ["GOOGLE CAROUSEL The Trauma Professional's Blog Falls vs Abuse In Kids: Differences In Injury Patterns Nonaccidental trauma (NAT) in children, a.k.a. child abuse, is a problem that trauma professionals see all too frequently. Much of the time, the abuse is obvious. Sometimes, it is more insidious and occult, and we can be misdirected by the history given by the caregivers. The most frequent story used to cover up obvious injuries child abuse is that the child fell. \u00a0Unfortunately, the injuries observed from abuse may be very similar to those seen from shaking, grabbing, lifting, and throwing. A paper that is currently in press from the University of Colorado at Aurora seeks to clarify this a bit, trying to tease out nuances in common injury patterns that may help us distinguish NAT from falls. They performed a retrospective database review at both Denver Health and Children\u2019s Health Colorado over a 15 year period. They specifically looked at children with blunt abdominal trauma. Unfortunately, they chose the age group < 18 years as\u00a0\u201cchildren\u201d, which muddies the picture somewhat.\u00a0 Here are the factoids: Of the 1,005 blunt abdominal trauma cases identified, 65 were confirmed to be due to NAT, and 115 were actually from falls 63 of the 65 NAT victims were less than 5 years old , but only 35 of the falls were Average ISS for the NAT kids was 20, vs only 12 for falls There were more hollow viscus injuries in NAT kids (25 vs 2), and more pancreatic injuries (16 vs 2) If a head injury was present, it was more severe with NAT Hospital LOS was longer after NAT, which makes sense given the ISS and head info above Bottom line:\u00a0Unfortunately, the authors could accumulate only a small amount of data over 15 years, but it paints a clear picture. Injured children presenting with a history of falls, particularly young children who can\u2019t engage in the high energy pursuits of adolescents, should arouse suspicion. If multiple injuries are found, especially visceral or deep solid organ abdominal injury (pancreas), suspect foul play. Similarly, if the head injury is more severe, be suspicious. All trauma professionals need to keep the possibility of NAT in the back of their minds on every \u00a0injured child they see!

The patient\u2019s habitus made a manual exam difficult. POCUS showed that there was some small bowel at the tender area which wouldn\u2019t compress and wouldn\u2019t move with pressure and with no peristalsis. The usual CT revealed a hernia but no incarceration, not surprising because her pain was almost gone by then. A hernia repair was done the same day. This patient had an umbilical hernia repair the week before. Her umbilicus was sort of painful. It looked somewhat painful. Sure enough POCUS showed an abscess. Editor\u2019s note: \u00a0Not only is it relatively easy to determine if a potential hernia has small bowel contents but POCUS helps tell you if your reduction is going well. \u00a0I have observed some where the neck of the hernia is tiny and the bowel oedematous and unlikely to squeeze back through which helped in getting an urgent surgical opinion. \u00a0 Filed in: Cases \u2022 Tags: abscess , hernia , POCUS , reduction , umbilicus You can start editing here.

We\u2019ve been pondering this question for nearly 30 years. In 1983, trauma surgeons at UCLA looked at a number of devices available at that time and tested them on normal volunteers. They measured neck motion to see which was \u201cbest.\u201d Here\u2019s what they found: Soft collar - In general, this decreased rotation by 8 degrees but insignificantly protected against flexion and extension. Basically, this keeps your neck warm and little else. Hard collars - A variety of collars available in that era were tested. They all allowed about 8% flexion, 18% lateral movement, and 2% rotation. The Philadelphia collar allowed the least extension. Sandbags and tape - Surprisingly, this was the best. It allowed no flexion and only a few percent movement in any other direction. The Mayo clinic compared four specific hard collars in 2007 (Miami J, Miami J with Occian back, Aspen, Philadelphia). They found that the Miami J and Philadelphia collars reduced neck movement the best. The Miami J with or without the Occian back provided the best relief from pressure. The Aspen allowed more movement in all axes. And finally, the halo vest is the gold standard. These tend to be used rarely and in very special circumstances. Bottom line: For EMS : Rigid collar per your protocol is the standard. In a pinch you can use good old tape and sandbags with excellent results. For physicians : The Miami J provides the most limitation of movement. If the collar will be needed for more than a short time, consider the well-padded Occian back Miami J (see below).

Background B-lines are are an ultrasound resonance artefact that appears when there is a marked difference in acoustic impedance between an object and it\u00b4s surroundings. On the screen it looks like a beam projecting from the pleura all the way to the edge of the screen. Lung water interfacing with air can be the source of the resonance and it is commonly seen i pulmonary oedema. Three or more\u00a0B-lines per field of scan with a distance between B-lines <7mm is considered indicative of pulmonary oedema. The present study tries to correlate B-profile on US with another marker of heart failure, pro-BNP which is produced by overstretched cardiomyocytes when left ventricle filling pressure is increased. A-lines A-lines, on the other hand,\u00a0indicate dry interlobar septa and is a normal finding. A-lines are a reverberation artefact of the pleura. On US they appear as one or more horisonal lines. Predominance of A lines is commonly suggestive of astma/COPD rather than oedema as the cause of dyspnoea. The study A prospective study that included\u00a0adult patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnoea likely to be explained by pulmonary oedema and left ventricular failure. All patients had bilateral anterior and lateral lung ultrasound scan\u00a0using a curvilinear probe. Images were stored and then reviewed by an independent ICU physiscian. Patients were based on US labelled B-line dominant profile or A-line dominant profile. \u00a0Median Pro-BNP values were determined. Results The authors enrolled 61 patients, 47 of which had a B-profile on lung ultrasound. 46 of these had a positive proBNP (related to age) with a median NT-proBNP of 6200. 14 patients had an A-profile on lung US, 10 of which had a negative pro-BNP. Their median pro BNP was 180. Take home message The European Society of Cardiology recommends using natriuretic peptide to rule out acute heart failure with reasonably high sensitivity albeit with low specificity. The sensitivity and specificity for lung US in detecting elevated pro-BNP indicative of heart failure is 92% and 91%.

The patient has not even left the EMS stretcher and is being wheeled out to the lab when one of your nurses notices an O2 sat of 92 to 93% on the final set of vitals prior to discharge. \u00a0This patient has no known respiratory disease and is a nonsmoker. \u00a0Would a STEMI cause this modest hypoxia? Of course you stop the EMS staff to do a further\u00a0assessment, knowing your door to needle time is being delayed for every second you take. \u00a0The pressure is on! \u00a0A quick bedside echo shows this: RV dilation A4C 3 You quickly notify the cath lab that this patient has a dilated RV and there is no old echo available to say this isn\u2019t acute. \u00a0Lung scan shows no edema. \u00a0RV infarct and PE are on the differential, with PE being the number one concern as the lungs aren\u2019t wet but we have hypoxia. \u00a0They take the patient anyway, open up and stent a proximal RCA occlusion, then immediately get a chest CT that confirms large bilateral PE\u2019s. This case is a reminder to me why you should try to do a bedside echo on every ischemic sounding chest pain patient, even when the presentation seems clear cut. \u00a0Unfortunately more than one bad thing can happen at once, usually the first triggering the second.

Young males are exposed to accidents and violence. Young males also tend to engage in profoundly stupid activities. However, since a decade or so there is\u00a0a shift. Major trauma in the elderly has become increasingly common. Authors have since long predicted that the elderly eventually will be the dominant demographic. A study\u00a0in EMJ suggests that has already happened. The study A massive UK trauma database called TARN (Trauma Audit Research Network) was reviewed to identify all cases of major trauma (ISS > 15) between 1990 and 2013. Victims were then sorted into age groups. Common mechanisms of injury were analysed. Results In 1990 the mean age of patients suffering major trauma in the was UK 36,1 years. \u00a039,3% of of patients were younger\u00a0than 25 years. 8,1% of victims were older than 75 years. Then,\u00a0throughout the\u00a0study period, mean age steadily increased. In 2013 the mean age of victims was 53,8 years. Under-25s had decreased to 17%. The percentage of victims older than 75 years had exploded, increased three-fold and\u00a0were now up at 26,9%. During the study period the mechanisms of injury (MOI) had dramatically changed. In 1990 road traffic collisions (RTCs) caused nearly 60% of major trauma while low fall (from <2m) accidents caused 4,7%. By 2013 low fall accidents had increased to 39,1% while RTCS had halved to under 30%. Take-home message In the UK\u00a0it seems trauma no longer is the young man\u2019s disease. Mean age of major trauma victims has increased from 36,1 to 53,8 years. The most common MOI in\u00a0major trauma is no longer traffic accidents but falls from heights below 2m. Possible explanations: RTCs are no longer the dominant MOIs for major trauma victims. Increase in numbers of older people in the general population. Improved detection and reporting of trauma in the elderly. Study lives here. Available for FREE and a must-read.

The involved area always becomes \u201cinfected\u201d whenever the patient develops a fever, and this is the 3 rd and most severe episode. 1 st episode \u2013 2 years ago, the family was still living in Mexico, and at that time the rash was diagnosed\u00a0as an insect bite. Mom empirically treated\u00a0with topical antibiotics. Within a week, the lesion\u00a0resolved, but the patient was left with a small, dark, discolored area in its place. 2 nd episode \u2013 1 year ago, he had an episode of fever and diarrhea with a red, pruritic\u00a0lesion on right posterior thigh. Again, a topical antibiotic was\u00a0placed on the area. After resolution of the\u00a0illness, the redness improved, but he was left with an even larger dark discoloration at the site. 3 rd episode \u2013 5 days ago, the patient developed\u00a0fever and URI symptoms. On Day 2 of illness, a red, pruritic,\u00a0blistering area started developing on right posterior thigh. He was diagnosed in ED with cellulitis and sent home with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. On Day 3, the\u00a0fever and URI symptoms began to resolve, but the rash was progressing\u00a0despite compliance with the antibiotic. Today, the rash looks like this: Physical Exam \u2013 Well appearing, afebrile.

History-taking is key Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen are commonly implicated in fixed drug eruptions. The mainstay of treatment is to prevent recurrence of the eruption by avoiding the offending drug \u00a0 References Cossey, M. et al.\u00a0Visual Diagnosis:8-Year-Old Boy With Recurrent Rash.

This ECG is from an article in the New England Journal on pericarditis. \u00a0 Acute Pericarditis Martin M. LeWinter, M.D. N Engl J Med 2014; 371:2410-2416 December 18, 2014 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMcp1404070 A reader had read this post on ST depression in lead aVL in pericarditis vs. inferior STEMI .\u00a0 He sent this ECG recorded from a patient with pericarditis and asked why there is ST depression in lead aVL: There is sinus rhythm with diffuse ST elevation (especially in inferolateral leads, which is typical of pericarditis). \u00a0There is diffuse PR depression and Spodick's sign. There is a tiny amount of reciprocal ST depression in lead aVL. My answer to the reader is below: As there are always exceptions to every rule , one must look at every ECG individually. There is minimal ST depression in aVL, perhaps 0.5 mm. Put that into the context of the whole ECG : there is very significant ST elevation in inferior leads.\u00a0 This is not subtle. When there is inferior MI with large ST elevation, there is nearly always marked reciprocal ST depression in aVL. Proportional Analysis Always interpret every ECG with proportional analysis. \u00a0Everything should be proportional to everything else for any given diagnosis. \u00a0\u00a0 In this case, you see very large inferior ST elevation, but only minimal (if any) reciprocal ST depression. \u00a0 The proportions do not make sense. \u00a0This would be exceptionally unusual for inferior MI. ST axis analysis The ST elevation is higher in lead II (3mm) than lead III (2mm). \u00a0This is also a pretty good ECG sign for pericarditis, as it implies the ST axis is closer to lead II than III, and less than 90 degrees. \u00a0When there is ST depression in aVL, the ST axis must be to the right of lead II (greater than 90 degrees). \u00a0Thus, the ST axis is between leads II and aVF (60-90 degrees). \u00a0However, the fact that there is such minimal ST depression in lead aVL tells us that the ST axis is only BARELY greater than 60 degrees, perhaps 65 degrees. \u00a0Thus, it is still very close to the normal axis for pericarditis (up to 60 degrees) and it is unusually leftward for inferior STEMI. But, as I always say, you diagnose pericarditis at your peril , so always approach this with caution! Steve Smith Posted by Steve Smith at 9:58 AM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Reactions: \u00a0 5 comments: Anonymous February 20, 2016 at 3:12 AM After your explanations I have learned that the proportionality principle is a general and important one when interpreting also an ECG like this. But I wonder whether there are some numeric values as they exist for example for ST/S in LBBB+ami. In other words, in this ECG there is a very tiny ST depression but my answer is: does exist, let say, an STE-inf/STD-avl ratio? Perhaps did you already evaluate this matter? More on the topic of proportionality, please. Thanks. By reasoning just on this ECG only (that is, without having additional clinical or Echo informations, always helpful), another sign of pericarditis may be the ST-depression in AVR. As you have magistrally explained, the ST vector in pericarditis is between 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 thus opposite to AVR, therefore very different to that of inferior STEMI. For these reasons there should ALWAYS be ST-depression in AVR in pericarditis. Isn't it? Many thanks. Mario Parrinello Reply Delete Replies Steve Smith February 20, 2016 at 7:53 AM Mario, this ECG still \"breaks the rule\" of ST depression in aVL. It does so because the ST vector is a bit farther right (65 degrees) than the rule would state that it should be. The proportion thing comes in only because one would not be able to detect this slight ST axis deviation if there was not a lot of ST amplitude. aVR is opposite an imaginary lead exactly between I and II (opposite of 30 degrees, which is -210 degrees. Any ST axis that is between -60 and +120 will have ST depression in aVR. This includes all pericarditis and all inferior STEMI! Steve Smith Delete Reply Anonymous February 26, 2016 at 2:30 PM I think that the diagnosis in this patient would have been difficult We need serial ecg to make sure we did not miss an AMI We cannot be so sure from a single ecg traditional and basic fact that st depression in pericarditis happens only in avr and v1 Thanks Reply Delete nas955 March 4, 2016 at 10:46 AM The ST elevation in inferior MI is convex upward and not concave. ..besides one would see ST depression in aVL CONCAVE and not convex as a reciprocal change in inferior MI Reply Delete Replies Steve Smith March 4, 2016 at 2:42 PM That is not at all a reliable rule and is, in fact, dangerous.

Don't Forget The Brain ! Chest compression are the core of resuscitation efforts in any patient with confirmed or suspected cardiac arrest. Good CPR should not be thought as heart-only process, but a combination of heart and brain.\u00a0 \u00a0 Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation consists of manual chest compressions to maintain blood flow and positive-pressure breathing to maintain oxygenation until spontaneous circulation is restored. Chest compressions are interrupted frequently by ventilations given as rescue breathing during the treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These interruptions reduce blood flow and potentially reduce the effectiveness of CPR. Observational studies involving humans with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause have suggested that continuous compressions are associated with better survival than interrupted compressions. Nichol et al. conducted a randomized trial to test whether continuous chest compressions, as compared with chest compressions interrupted for ventilation, during CPR performed by emergency medical service (EMS) providers affected the rate of survival, neurologic function, or the rate of adverse events. In the large randomized trial conducted by Nichol et al. involving adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a strategy of continuous manual chest compressions with positive-pressure ventilation was not associated with a significantly higher rate of survival to discharge. During the active-enrollment phase, 1129 of 12,613 patients (9.0%) in the intervention group (which received continuous chest compression) and 1072 of 11,035 (9.7%) in the control group (which received interrupted chest compressions) survived to hospital discharge (difference with adjustment for cluster and sequential monitoring, \u22120.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22121.5 to 0.1; P=0.07). In the study by Nichol et al., secondary outcomes included neurologic function at discharge, which was measured with the use of the modified Rankin scale (scores range from 0, indicating no symptoms, to 6, indicating death, with a score of \u22643 indicating favorable neurologic function) on the basis of review of the clinical record, and adverse events. Among patients with available data on neurologic status, 883 of 12,560 patients (7.0%) in the intervention group and 844 of 10,995 (7.7%) in the control group survived with a modified Rankin scale score of 3 or less (difference with adjustment for cluster, \u22120.6 percentage points; 95% CI, \u22121.4 to 0.1; P=0.09). Hospital-free survival in the Nichol trial was defined as the number of days alive and permanently out of the hospital during the first 30 days after the cardiac arrest. Hospital-free survival was significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (mean difference, \u22120.2 days; 95% CI, \u22120.3 to \u22120.1; P=0.004). Previous observational studies have shown large increases in survival rates among patients with a shockable rhythm with the implementation of continuous compressions by EMS providers versus compressions interrupted for ventilations. Among patients with a noncardiac cause of cardiac arrest who were treated by laypersons or those with a nonshockable rhythm who were treated by EMS providers, continuous compressions were not associated with a significant improvement in outcome. In these previous studies, participating EMS agencies did not measure CPR process when implementing continuous compressions, and implementation occurred simultaneously with other changes, including directions to give intravenous epinephrine early, to use a nonrebreather mask with passive ventilation, to defer airway insertion, and to reduce the number of defibrillations given with each rhythm analysis. In the initial reports of implementation of continuous compressions, most patients received rescue breathing by means of positive-pressure ventilation with a bag-valve mask. Other interventions that each patient received were not reported. It seems plausible that some of the observed improvement in these previous studies was due to improved CPR process (e.g., compression rate and depth), concurrent improvements in the system of care, or Hawthorne effects (changes in behavior resulting from awareness of being observed) rather than to the implementation of continuous compressions alone. In Summary... - Rapid initiation of chest compression increases survival with better neurological outcome. - Avoiding interruptions during chest compression is key for brain perfusion. - Defibrillate for shockable rhythms.\u00a0 - Teaching the\u00a0general public on how to do high quality chest compressions can make a real difference.

The \"Atomic Cold\" Disease In the ED we see kids with coughs and colds every day. Among those, a number of\u00a0children have bronchiolitis. Few diseases have a greater effect on the health of young children than viral lower respiratory tract illness. Approximately 800,000 children in the United States, or approximately 20% of the annual birth cohort, require outpatient medical attention during the first year of life because of illness caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The simplest way to think about this disease that will help identifying children with bronchiolitis is this: Imagine an infant (or toddler) with a cold, pouring boogers from his nose, who looks sicker than the usual \"cold\". Yes... that's it! Think\u00a0about it as the \"Atomic Cold\" RSV accounts for 50 to 80% of all hospitalizations for bronchiolitis during seasonal epidemics in North America. Although the clinical features of bronchiolitis due to different viruses are generally indistinguishable, some differences in the severity of disease have been reported. For example, it has been observed that rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis may result in a shorter length of hospitalization than bronchiolitis that is attributable to RSV. Differences in the response to medical intervention have not been identified consistently among children with bronchiolitis caused by different viruses.\u00a0 [if gte mso 9]> 0 0 1 239 1367 Sinc 11 3 1603 14.0 Normal 0 false false false EN-US JA X-NONE /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;}"]}
